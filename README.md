These files are the necessary files to run the computational modeling presented in Brown, Medina, Vaaga, Holla and Raman. 
Model_Traces: contains all the simulated raw synaptic traces and spike traces.
Model_Simulations: contains all the code to generate all the simulated data in the manuscript.
Model_Analysis: loads the output of Model_Simulations and plots the data as PSTHs.
